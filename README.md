# Database-Program
This is a python script to scrape the catalog that I am working on with Dr. Kovalev and convert all the data inside the catalog into an Excel spreadsheet.
The catalog itself is organized in a very standard and systematic way. However, that way is not conducive to data analysis.
Rather, it is merely an organized method of displaying data. This python script intends to use regular expressions to convert this catalog into an Excel spreadsheet.
Having this data in spreadsheet form will allow for vast data analysis, and new insights can certainly be gleamed from such "Big Data."
Indeed, with the advent of modern computing, machine learning, and "Big Data," it is high time history and numismatics enters this field.
This python script, and the eventual creation of the aforementioned spreadsheet, will hopefully propell the two disciplines into that era.
